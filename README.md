# hashr - Various hash algorithms in Rust

[![tests](https://github.com/xrjr/hashr/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xrjr/hashr/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Currently supported algorithms :
- sha1
- hmac-sha1
- hotp

The library *might* support other hashing algorithms, as well as encryption algorithms.

Warning : I am by no means an expert in cryptography. Of course the goal of the library is to follow the RFCs and test as well as I can but implementations might or might not be correct.
