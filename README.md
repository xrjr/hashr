## Supported algorithms

- [x] sha1
- [x] hmac
- [x] hotp/totp
- [ ] md5
- [ ] sha256/224

## Informations

The library *might* support other hashing algorithms, as well as encryption algorithms.

Warning : I am by no means an expert in cryptography. Of course the goal of the library is to follow the RFCs and test as well as I can but implementations might or might not be correct.
